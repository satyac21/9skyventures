# 9skyventures Website Redesign (Design Test)

## Overview
This project is a design test submission for 9Sky Ventures. The deliverables include a PRD covering research, analysis, target users & personas, as well as UI/UX enhancement suggestions and also Figma File for the wireframe based on the test instructions outlined in the submission requirements provided via email.

## Deliverables
- **Product Requirements Document (PRD):** Contains detailed research, pain points, user persona, and proposed solutions.  
- **Wireframes (Figma):** Link to the wireframes is included in the PRD under the "Proposed Design" section or you can access it [here](https://www.figma.com/design/E68leH45UTIHedF3aDOcRm/9SKyVentures?node-id=0-1&t=vxEJT8qxxBRxKIVt-1)  
- **Placeholder Content:** The wireframes serve as a quick sketch to visualize the structure. The text and visuals are placeholders, but all key features and details are outlined in the PRD.

## Notes
- The wireframes focus on layout and user flow for MVP (must-have) rather than finalized content.  
- Any missing details or refinements can be iterated upon based on feedback.
